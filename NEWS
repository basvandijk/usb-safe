  instance MkTransferDirection Out where mkTransferDirection = Out
  instance MkTransferDirection In  where mkTransferDirection = In

* Added getEndpoints' which uses these overloaded functions.

  getEndpoints' ∷ ∀ transDir transType sAlt r
                . MkTransferDirection transDir
                ⇒ MkTransferType transType
                ⇒ AlternateHandle sAlt r
                → [Endpoint transDir transType sAlt r]
  getEndpoints' altHndl = getEndpoints altHndl mkTransferDirection mkTransferType
